/**
 * Scanner probes (2026-09-12). Bots sweep the whole IPv4 space asking every
 * host for `/.env`, `/laravel/.env`, `/.git/config`, `/phpinfo.php`, WordPress
 * paths and so on -- hundreds of variants in a few seconds, hoping one target
 * in a thousand serves its secrets. Tom saw exactly this in a hosting log.
 *
 * This app never serves those files: secrets live in the ignored `.env`
 * outside `dist/public`, and express.static ignores dotfiles anyway. But until
 * now every such request fell through to the SPA fallback and got a 200 with
 * index.html -- which tells a scanner "something is here, keep going", and
 * left no trace in our own logs. Three things change here, in the order the
 * thread's consensus and fail2ban practice suggest:
 *
 *   1. A probe path gets a bare 404 immediately -- no HTML, no app work, no
 *      hint. (Not 400 as in Tom's screenshot: 400 says "I understood you and
 *      you are wrong", 404 says "nothing here".)
 *   2. Each probe is counted per IP. Past PROBE_BAN_THRESHOLD in an hour the
 *      IP is refused outright for the rest of that hour -- in-process
 *      fail2ban. A shopper does not ask for `/.env` five times by accident.
 *   3. One compact console line per probe, so `pnpm dev` (or PM2's log) shows
 *      the scan the way a web server's access log would.
 *
 * Real paths with dots stay untouched: /.well-known (ACME, app links),
 * /favicon.ico, /robots.txt, /sitemap.xml, /face-models/*.json, /cdn/*,
 * /assets/* -- the rules below match only the files nobody legitimately
 * requests from this app. `isScannerProbe` is pure so it is unit-tested
 * against both lists.
